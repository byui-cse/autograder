This is still a work in progress but the primary functionality has been completed. To try out the autograder make sure you have run `npm install` once, and then start the demo with `npm run demo`.

You can change the URLs in `demo/autograder.js` to see the grader work on different sites; the plan is to allow file uploads as well.

You can modify the custom tests by modifying the files in `app/examples`.

I will have to cover the linters later, they are stuck on the default settings for now in `app/configs`. The ultimate goal is we can check for / enforce anything we want.
